			<h2>Who am I ?</h2> 
	 
	 			<p>
	 			My name is Mathieu Echevin I’m 18 years old. I was born in Paris but grew up in Lyon. During my childhood, I had the opportunity to practice many activities. I started playing tennis from the age of 5 to 10. In the meantime, I started to play an instrument: the oboe. I played this instrument for almost ten years. At the age of 8, I decided that I wanted to play football, so I started this sport and played it for 10 years. </p>

				<p id="business-school"> 
				I am currently in my first year of the Global BBA program at ESSEC Business School in Cergy.  However, my background did not predestine me for a future in business school. I obtained my baccalaureate in 2021 with a major in mathematics, physics and chemistry. It was after meeting someone at a student fair that I decided to go to a business school. Today I do not regret this choice at all and I am convinced that it is the most adapted to who I am.</p>
